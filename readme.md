# MagickLock

This project was made for the course LINFO 1001 of the UCLouvain, the goal is to secure a message on a Sense hat, the message is hidden behind a snake game.

## Acces the Safe box UI

In order to acces the safe box, when the snake game starts you need to remember the color of the title `Snake` when the game starts. After you saw the title an other screen is displayed with random pairs of colors, but one is not of a pair and is the color of the title, it's where you need to go in less than 15 moves to unlock the Safe box.

## Requirements

* Sense Hat with python 3 installed
